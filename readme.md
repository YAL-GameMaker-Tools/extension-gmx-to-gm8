# ExtGmxToGml8
Converts GameMaker: Studio extension files into series of scripts for use with GameMaker 8.1 and earlier.

That is, concats the GML files as-is and converts the extension function nodes for C++ files (as seen in GUI) to external_define declarations and scripts calling them.

Then you can drag the resulting GML file onto an open GameMaker window to import a script directory.

Included files will have to be added separately.
